# Space Shooter

Space Shooter is an exciting Pygame-based game where the player controls a spaceship to defend against waves of invading aliens. The game is designed to be fun and challenging, with progressively harder levels as the player advances.

## Game Description

In Space Shooter, the player controls a ship. The player can move the ship up and down using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves towards the ship. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the ship or reaches the screen's left border, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

## Features
